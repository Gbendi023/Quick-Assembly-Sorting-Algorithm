# Quick-Assembly-Sorting-Algorithm
This AVR assembly project for the ATxmega128A1U reads 8-bit values from program memory and processes them based on specific conditions. Depending on bit 7, values are multiplied or divided with adjustments. The filtered output, when viewed in ASCII, spells "EElabworld."
